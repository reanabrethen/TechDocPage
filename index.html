            <code>attributes</code>
            <p>There are several different attributes for each element in HTML. They usually come in name & value pairs (ex.: name="value")
                <ul>
                    <li>The "a" tag defines a hyperlink (a clickable link within text). The "href" attribute is used to specify the URL the link will go to</li>
                    <li>The "img" tag is used to embed an image within an HTML page. The "src" attribute is used to specify the path & will display the image on the web browser </li>
                    <li>The "html" tag will use the "lang" attribute to define the language used on a Web page. This can change via the language used for the page itself (ex.: lang="en" for English language used on webpage)</li>
                    <li>The "title" attribute is used to provide more information about an element (ex. title="Lorem, ipsum.")</li>
                </ul>

Your Technical Documentation project should use at least one media query.



You should have a main element with an id of main-doc.
You should have at least five section elements with a class of main-section.
All of your .main-section elements should be section elements.
You should have at least five .main-section elements that are descendants of #main-doc.
The first child of each .main-section should be a header element.
None of your header elements should be empty.
All of your .main-section elements should have an id.
Each .main-section should have an id that matches the text of its first child, having any spaces in the child's text replaced with underscores (_) for the id's.
You should have at least 10 p elements (total) within your .main-section elements.
You should have at least five code elements that are descendants of .main-section elements.
You should have at least five li elements that are descendants of .main-section elements.
You should have a nav element with an id of navbar.
Your #navbar should have exactly one header element within it.
You should have at least one a element with a class of nav-link.
All of your .nav-link elements should be anchor (a) elements.
All of your .nav-link elements should be in the #navbar.
You should have the same number of .nav-link and .main-section elements.
The header element in the #navbar should come before any link (a) elements also in the #navbar.
Each .nav-link should have text that corresponds to the header text of its related section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your #navbar should have a .nav-link which has the text "Hello world").
Each .nav-link should have an href attribute that links to its corresponding .main-section (e.g. If you click on a .nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element with that id).
Your #navbar should always be on the left edge of the window.
